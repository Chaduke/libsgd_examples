Video Descriptions 

To get started with LibSGD, go to the LibsGD Examples Github Repository linked below.  
Scroll down to the README area and follow the instructions step by step.  
Links to each one of these videos will be in each area.  

If you want get started quickly go the Python route as its a little easier to setup and free, but if you want a deeper learning experience go the C route or both.

Supporting LibSGD through Patreon will allow you to get a closer look at its development as well as report bugs, ask questions, and make suggestions directly to the developer (Mark Sibly).  You'll be getting a product worth so much more than the amount required to get involved.  I'll also be spending most of my free time working on these tutorials and videos, as well and other members of the community.
